"""The indentation and whitespace gate for private projects.

One tool, merged from three that had grown apart:

  fuzzypickles/tools/tabify.py    the C/C++ fixer (brace-nesting lexer)
  beerssh/tools/tabify.py         a copy of it, drifted in the docstring only
  */tools/check-indent.sh         file enumeration plus the collapse floor
  situ/tools/lint_conventions.py  the checker: ASCII, tabs, trailing space,
                                  final newline, with a tokenize-based
                                  exemption for Python string literals

The two tabify.py copies were byte-identical in code and differed only in
their docstrings, which is the cheap kind of drift. The two check-indent.sh
copies had genuinely diverged -- different discovery, different scope,
different floor -- and both were right for their own tree, which is why
those differences are configuration here rather than a winner.

A fourth capability existed in none of them: fixing Python. tabify.py's
lexer counts braces and cannot see a Python block, so apt-emerge's
conversion was done by a throwaway script. That approach is folded in.

Every fixer carries a proof rather than a promise:

  C/C++   expanding leading tabs back to `indent_width` columns must give
          the original file. Only leading whitespace is ever rewritten.
  Python  the AST must be identical before and after. ast.dump() without
          attributes is position-free but carries every string constant,
          so an identical dump means no block and no literal moved.

A fixer that cannot prove its own edit refuses to write it.

Usage:
    style_gate.py check [--root DIR] [PATH...]
    style_gate.py fix   [--root DIR] PATH...
    style_gate.py list  [--root DIR]      # what would be checked, and why

Configuration is `.style-gate.toml` at the project root; every key is
optional. See DEFAULTS below for the meaning and the shipped values.
